Collection of footprints and symbols for my KiCad projects

To use the 3D files in the Footprints two Enviroment Variables have to be set:

* BBLIB_3D: for the free STEP and VRML files. These can be found here: https://github.com/TheUncleKai/bbkicad_3d

* BBLIB_3D_NONFREE: Indicates there are 3D files from the vendor. You can setup a own directory on your Machine and copy these to the correct place.
